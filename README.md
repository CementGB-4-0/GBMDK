# GBMDK
Gang Beasts Mod Development Kit. Contains dummy scripts and resources for building assets for Gang Beasts mods. 
[Requires Cement 4.0]() (link pending)

## Disclaimer
This project DOES NOT and SHOULD NOT contain vanilla Gang Beasts assets, such as audio, meshes, textures, etc. in their entirety.  
Some ripped data values are used, such as serialized MonoBehaviour field presets.  
All Gang Beasts code is stripped from the ripped scripts. These scripts must ONLY contain gizmos and other editor-specific helpers as working code.  

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
- Unity v2021.3.33f1 (``unityhub://2021.3.33f1/ee5a2aa03ab2`` (open as link in browser))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) (optional, makes things easier)

### Steps
1. Click `Use this template > Create a new repository` in the top right corner of the repository page (may require a GitHub account)
2. Fill out your repository's name, if you want it to be public or not, etc.
3. Create the repository.
4. Clone the repository by pressing the green `Code` button and using GitHub Desktop or simply downloading it as a `.zip`.
5. Once downloaded, open the repository as a Unity project in Unity Hub. This may take a long time.
6. Clear the errors and make sure none persist. If they do, or if you encounter script errors later on while developing, report it as a bug on the [Cement discord](https://discord.gg/fCwXc5k43w).
